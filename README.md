# sso-iweb-x

This will be the future repository for my *Iweb-X* tool. It's almost done, but I'm still adding more features. 

This is a preview what I have for now!

Everything is working flawely and it will help a lot new starting servers, but, anyway, if some server just wants to make some deal so I don't release this to everyone, I'm up at least for a brief conversation!

## Auto Sending

With this you can basically create schedules for gift sendings based on filters provided in the previous feature. So for instance, you can make a custom send to all players that logged in the last week/month/day/year, or even based on the total cash spent.
